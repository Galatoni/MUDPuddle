# MUDPuddle
PHP Backend for a fully configurable and flexible MUD engine, will also include web interface. Inspired by the old text-adventures and Multi-User Dungeons of old. This aims to add a little more to the mix.

Features to include:
* Graphics to augment text-only environments (jpeg, gif, maybe even video)
* Audio for some interactions for immersion
* Support for a general lexicon and support for custom actions
* Inventory system
* API
* Tutorial module
* Be easily configurable to load new adventures/environments that can be generated by anyone.

Makes use of a PuPHPet manifest, so generating the needed VM should be as easy as 'vagrant up' from the directory. This should get development up and running a lot faster.

# Get Developing
I'm hoping this will become a really nice place for people to mix ideas and simply get coding. Any experience level is welcome and encouraged to take part. Have an idea? Get forking and get cracking. Problems? Need advice/help? Just ask!
